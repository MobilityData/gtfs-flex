Updated: November 25, 2020. The spec in this repository is now the most up-to-date version of GTFS-Flex. The code in this repo contains the official proposal for GTFS-Flex v2, a GTFS extension that covers all demand-responsive services for the purposes of discovery in trip planning. All features of this specification proposal are currently produced by [Trillium](https://trilliumtransit.com/) and consumed by [OpenTripPlanner version 2](https://www.opentripplanner.org/). DemandTrans and IBI group expect to produce data in this spec by early 2021.

"Version 1" of the GTFS-Flex specification is utilized by OTP 1.4. You can review the Version 1 specification by reviewing versions of this repository from before October 2020.

### About GTFS-Flex

GTFS-Flex is a proposed extension to the [General Transit Feed Specification](http://gtfs.org/). GTFS-Flex adds the capability to model various demand-responsive transportation (DRT) services to GTFS, which currently only models fixed-route public transportation. GTFS-flex is now produced for over 100 transit services, and provides flexible transit trip plans through [OpenTripPlanner](https://www.opentripplanner.org/).
